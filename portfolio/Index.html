      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Voice Assistant</h3>
          <p>This project involved developing a voice assistant using Python. The goal was to create a program that could understand and respond to voice commands, providing a hands-free and interactive user experience.</p>
          <p>The voice assistant utilized various Python libraries, including speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis. It could recognize a set of predefined commands such as retrieving weather information, playing music, setting reminders, and answering general knowledge questions.</p>
          <p>To achieve this functionality, the project employed natural language processing techniques and integrated with external APIs for specific tasks such as weather data retrieval and music playback.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the voice assistant featured a user-friendly interface with audio feedback, allowing users to interact with the system through voice commands and receive spoken responses.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Temperature Converter</h3>
          <p>The Temperature Converter project involved creating a user-friendly application that allows users to convert temperatures between different units of measurement.</p>
      <p>The project was implemented using Python and provided a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use. Users could input a temperature value in one unit (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin) and convert it to other units instantly.</p>
      <p>The temperature conversion logic was implemented using appropriate mathematical formulas and calculations for accurate and reliable results. The application handled conversions between popular temperature units, including Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the application offered features such as error handling to handle invalid inputs and a clear interface to display the converted temperatures. Users could easily switch between input units and view the corresponding converted values in real-time.</p>
      <p>The Temperature Converter project served as a practical tool for anyone needing to convert temperatures quickly and efficiently, whether for scientific, educational, or everyday purposes.</p>
